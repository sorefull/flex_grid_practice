# Flex and grid practice

Learning of grid and flex tools, was nice and cool, first 40 minutes i thought that i am doing something wrong, and then I realized that Atom grid support sucks... So I opened page in Firefox and :tada: it worked. Design is not best and I was using css not scss, but I think result is fine. Happy coding!

Sources I was using:

* [flex source](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
* [grid source](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
